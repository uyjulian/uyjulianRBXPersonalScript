[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uyjulian/uyjulianRBXPersonalScript.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uyjulian/uyjulianRBXPersonalScript)  

This is my personal script, for use with Script Builders, which are areas in an online game called ROBLOX
which will allow you to execute any code.  
The original location of this script is located at https://pastebin.com/HPsh73iL  
This script may not be guarenteed to work with the latest version of ROBLOX.  
Before compiling this script, be sure to have luajit, moonscript, lua-zlib, zlib1g-dev, lua-parser, and serpent installed. You can run `sudo bash prepare-env.sh` to install these tools for you.  
Run `make` in this directory to compile the script. If you want to use multiple cores of your CPU, use `make -j2` where `2` is the number of cores that you want to use. The script will be located at `bin/uyjulianRBXPersonScript.lua` once it is finished compiling.
