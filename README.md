This is my personal script, for use with Script Builders, which are areas in an online game called ROBLOX
which will allow you to execute any code. The original location of this script is located at

This script currently does NOT work with the latest version of ROBLOX.  
Before compiling this script, be sure to have luajit, moonscript, zlib, lua-parser, serpent, and cURL installed.  
Run `make` in this directory to compile the script. The script will be located at `bin/uyjulianRBXPersonScript.lua`
